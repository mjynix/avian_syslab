# Avian Influenza Analysis Pipeline

This is a final report on how to run the script for my final project. 

My project investigates the evolutionary spread and variants of avian influenza using environmental and wastewater samples. By applying phylogenetic tools to previously under-analyzed datasets, I aim to look into how avian influenza evolves and spreads geographically and temporally. 

# ⚙️ About This Pipeline
The pipeline is designed to process raw sequencing data (FASTA/FASTQ), align sequences, perform variant calling and lineage deconvolution (via Freyja), generate maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees (via IQTree and TreeTime), and visualize data through time-series and geospatial plots. It is built for exploratory research and is not intended for clinical or diagnostic use. Original directions were provided to me by mentors.
